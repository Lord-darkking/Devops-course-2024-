# My DevOps Learning Journey  

## 1. Overview of My Learning  
My introduction to DevOps began as part of both academic exploration and practical experimentation. Over time, I have developed a working understanding of essential tools and methodologies pivotal in todayâ€™s DevOps landscape. Though not yet a seasoned expert, I have actively applied several technologies in small-scale implementations to gain hands-on proficiency.  

## 2. Tools and Technologies I've Learned  

### 2.1. Core Tools  
- **Docker**: Leveraged for packaging applications into containers for streamlined deployment across diverse environments.  
- **Kubernetes**: Deployed containerized workloads, explored ingress controllers for efficient traffic routing.  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD processes for application deployment.  
- **Terraform**: Utilized to codify infrastructure and orchestrate cloud resources such as EKS clusters.  
- **Jenkins**: Designed pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment stages.  
- **Kyverno**: Experimented with implementing security and compliance policies in Kubernetes clusters.  
- **Knative**: Explored serverless application deployment within Kubernetes environments.  
- **Service Mesh**: Familiarized myself with Istio to understand traffic flow and microservices communication.  

### 2.2. Concepts and Practices  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Developed automation for integrating, testing, and deploying code.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automated the creation and management of infrastructure resources with Terraform.  
- **Cloud Native Approaches**: Worked with EKS, AWS Lambda, and other cloud-native services for scalable deployment.  

## 3. My Contributions  

### 3.1. Blog Writing on Kubernetes  
I authored blogs to demystify Kubernetes for beginners, including:  
- **Unveiling Kubernetes Ingress Controller**: Explaining how ingress controllers route external traffic to internal services.  
- Setting up and managing clusters for both personal and professional use.  
- Integrating Kyverno to enforce governance policies in real-time.  

### 3.2. Blog Writing on Cloud Services  
My interest in cloud computing inspired me to write about multi-cloud strategies, such as:  
- **Navigating the Skies of AWS, Google, and Azure**: A comparative analysis of the three major cloud providers.  
- Streamlining cloud-based application deployment.  
- Leveraging cost-effective solutions for scaling services.  

### 3.3. GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
In a practical implementation of GitHub Actions, I:  
- Designed workflows to trigger automated builds and tests on each repository update.  
- Streamlined the deployment process by automating Docker container integration.  

### 3.4. EKS Clusters and IaC with Terraform  
Using Terraform, I defined infrastructure to provision and manage EKS clusters. This provided insights into:  
- Automating cluster setup and scaling.  
- Deploying and managing Kubernetes workloads on cloud platforms.  

## 4. Challenges and Learnings  
My journey through DevOps has been accompanied by various challenges, including:  
- Troubleshooting intricate Kubernetes configurations and debugging deployment errors.  
- Grasping the syntax and nuances of Terraform in multi-cloud environments.  
- Configuring service meshes and defining robust traffic management rules.  

These obstacles, while difficult, honed my ability to approach problems methodically and seek collaborative solutions.  

## 5. Future Goals  

### 5.1. Technical Skills  
- Expand my understanding of Kubernetes by diving deeper into Helm charts and CRDs.  
- Develop proficiency in observability platforms like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack.  
- Master advanced service mesh capabilities with tools such as Istio and Linkerd.  

By continuing to build on my foundational knowledge, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the DevOps community while sharpening my expertise.
